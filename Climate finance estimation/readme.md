# Explanations 

You will find several scripts: 

- Estimations of Climate Finance allows you to build the training set basing on the initial dataset (CRS OECD dataset)
- Relevance classifier to train for the first classifier
- Multi classifier to train for the second classifier
- Classify.py for classifying the whole dataset, once ClimateFinanceBERT trained
- Graph.py for Figures made in paper

These codes are made available for replication purposes and are inspirated by ClimateFinanceBERT, if you want to use it, please refer to original repository [Consistent and replicable estimation...](https://github.com/MalteToetzke/consistent-and-replicable-estimation-of-bilateral-climate-finance/tree/main)
