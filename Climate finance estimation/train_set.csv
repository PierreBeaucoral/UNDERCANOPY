3a-southern afr power mrkt apl 1 (fy04) 3a-southern afr power mrkt apl 1 (fy04) the southern african power market project for zambia aims to facilitate the development of an efficient regional power market which will: (i) decelerate the increase of electricity prices in the southern african development community countries through increased competition, (ii) increase industrial competitiveness of the region, (iii) create the conditions for accelerated investment in the power sector, including by the private sector, and (iv) foster regional integration. the project has the following four components: component 1) will support southern african power pool (sapp) coordination center including: an energy management system (ems). component 2) will increase the capacity of the transmission corridor from the democratic republic of congo (drc) to the sapp by: upgrading and rehabilitating the converter and inverter stations on the direct current (dc) transmission link from inga to kolwezi, maintaining the dc transmission line from inga to kolwezi and installing a new communication system on the line, rehabilitating and reinforcing the alternate current (ac) network from kolwezi to karavia substation in the katanga region of the drc (including the addition of reactive compensation equipment), constructing a 220 kv transmission line from fungurume to karavia substation and from karavia to the drc/zambia border complete with the provision of integrated infrastructure services along the line route. (it is important to note that copperbelt energy company (cec) of zambia, a private company, will arrange the financing and construction of the continuation of the new transmission line (45 km) from the drc/zambia border to luano substation near kitwe in zambia), carrying out mitigation of environmental and social impacts, and carrying out environmental studies for the future expansion of the drc power sector. component 3) the pooling of power resources offers unique, value-added advantages. it allows optimum use of available regional resources, enhances environmental protection efforts, facilitates a sustainable development approach, reduces the cost of electricity service to customers, increases the ability to meet potential customers' demand, reduces risk of power shortages and brings new revenue opportunities. component 4) project preparation and management - financing of the project will be coordinated by the bank, with co-financing expected from bilateral donors (usaid, norad). the program has been prepared with the financial support of a grant from japan (phrd grant for an amount of us$617,732). the recipient of the grant was the government of zimbabwe who passed it on to the sapp coordination center.;Renewable energy;1.0

adapting to climate change in the illimani watershed in the bolivian andes adapting to climate change in the illimani watershed in the bolivian andes the andes account for more than 98% of the world's tropical mountain glaciers. rural communities in nearby villages use glacier water for domestic consumption and agricultural production. now, however, rapid retreat of the glaciers, triggered by climate change, is threatening the water supply of such communities. given the pace at which the glaciers are retreating, there is an urgent need to look for alternative sources of water.the illimani glacier is close to the cities of la paz and el alto and has been identified as a potential new source of water. however, water availability in the illimani watershed is already decreasing as the rural population engages in the production of more profitable agricultural crops such as fruits and vegetables to meet the urban demand. diverting water to la paz and el alto would drastically reduce water availability in the watershed, affect food production and potentially trigger conflict between urban and rural populations.this grant will strengthen the capacity of local communities and authorities to devise a mid-to-long-term strategy for adapting to climate change in the illimani watershed. using scientific evidence from glaciology, hydrology and agronomy, researchers will assess the evolution and prepare a model of  water supply and demand in the region. taking into consideration indigenous knowledge and local risk mitigation strategies, they will identify ways of minimizing conflict over water resources with local stakeholders. the results will inform long-term decision-making regarding water in the cities of la paz and el alto.;Climate Adaptation;1.0
adapting to climate change in urbanizing watersheds adapting to climate change in urbanizing watersheds water scarcity and water-related vulnerability are ubiquitous in the indian sub-continent. climate change is likely to increase existing climate variability, thereby aggravating water related stresses, especially for marginalized groups. the process of rapid urbanization poses additional challenges to communities and water managers, as it brings increasing competition for scarce water resources.this research project will focus on two rapidly urbanizing watersheds: the arkavathy sub-basin in southern india and the darjeeling watershed in north-eastern india. the objective of the project is to understand the impact of climate change on the quality and quantity of water accessible for different water users in different locales and the household and institutional factors that shape vulnerability, short-term coping mechanisms, and adaptation strategies. the research approach draws upon a 'coupled human-environment systems' framework and builds on methods and insights from recent research on climate change and adaptation in india. it focuses attention on water users' priorities, seeks to integrate detailed biophysical research with an understanding of the social and technical mechanisms through which climate change impacts will be felt by water users. a participatory web-based simulation model will be used to generate knowledge of cumulative and cross-scale impacts. research results will be shared through peer reviewed publications, critical policy engagement and a 'summer institute' for researchers and civil society groups in south asia. this project is funded through the idrc research initiative on water resources and adaptation to climate change in asia and latin america and the caribbean with funds from the government of canada's fast-start climate change financing, 2011.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

amélioration de l'accès fiable et abordable à de l'électricité pour les familles et les institutions publiques prioritaires amélioration de l'accès fiable et abordable à de l'électricité pour les familles et les institutions publiques prioritaires background:  comme pour toute l'afrique, la production et l'accès à l'énergie sont de grands enjeux pour le développement du rwanda. ces enjeux font partie des priorités du rwanda. ainsi, l'énergie est une des priorités de la « vision 2020 », par laquelle le rwanda cherche à devenir un pays à revenus moyens en 2020. cette vision se traduit en divers plans stratégiques dont le dernier est l'economic development and poverty reduction strategy ii (edprs ii 2013 -2018) qui explique que « la croissance économique, parmi d'autres choses, sera poussée par la fourniture ininterrompue d'énergie à des prix qui seront stables et régionalement compétitifs ». l'accès à des sources modernes d'énergie à des prix abordables sera crucial si le pays veut réaliser ses objectifs de développement. cette volonté se traduit dans le plan stratégique sectoriel 2013 -2018 où le rwanda vise un mix énergétique au niveau de la production et une augmentation du nombre de foyers connectés. en regard de l'edprs ii, le plan stratégique prévoit 1) une augmentation des capacités de production électrique, notamment au travers des énergies renouvelables (563 mw pour 2018 selon edprs ii), 2) une augmentation de l'accès à l'électricité, 3) de garantir et de maintenir des tarifs compétitifs au niveau régional. la stratégie du rwanda est donc de garantir la « provision de fournitures énergétiques en suffisance, fiables et abordables pour tous les rwandais ».   la belgique appuie la production et l'accès à l'électricité depuis quelques années, au travers de ses interventions dans le « secteur » du développement rural. ainsi, elle a permis la construction par exemple de microcentrales hydroélectriques ou de lignes électriques. en 2011, un programme indicatif de coopération a été signé. l'un des secteurs de concentration est désormais l'énergie, à hauteur de 55 millions d'euros. la présente intervention concerne plus spécifiquement l'accès à l'électricité, l'extension et le renforcement du réseau, dans le monde rural.   des interventions sont prévues en parallèles à la présente intervention dans le domaine de la production géothermique d'électricité (27 millions d'euros), et le renforcement des capacités (appui à l'ewsa - energy, water and sanitation agency – 5 millions d'euros).     l'accès à l'électricité est essentiel pour le développement socio -économique du rwanda. le gouvernement du rwanda a mis sur pied un programme de renforcement du réseau : earp – electricity access roll -out program – afin de remplir les objectifs établis dans l'edprs. la première phase a été lancée en 2009 et a permis de passer de 6 à 16% de foyers connectés (en juin 2012). l'objectif sectoriel, dans l'energy sector strategic plan 2013 -2018, est fixé à 48% en 2018 on grid et 52% off grid (annexe 8). dès lors, une deuxième phase du earp (2013 -2017) a été lancée. le coût de cette extension est estimé à 570 millions de dollars us, un montant qui a été diminué par les nouveaux choix de politique sectorielle et l;Renewable energy;1.0

applying and evaluating a new quantitative method to selectclimate-resilient cereal varieties to improve farmer livelihoods andcommunity nutrition i applying and evaluating a new quantitative method to selectclimate-resilient cereal varieties to improve farmer livelihoods andcommunity nutrition i climate change seriously threatens peru food security. events such as the el niño phenomena continuously affect the most vulnerable (southern)part of the country, where native grains (mainly quinoa), cereals (wheat, barley) and tubers (potato) provide subsistence to highland families. insuch areas, water scarcity due to climate instability diminishes yields to less than a quarter of the optimal in all these crops, requiring food importsduring these times. thus locals need to sow climate-resilient varieties to assure survival.using historical crop yield data provided by unalm breeders, our previousproject validated a quantitative method (developed by thiry 2016) to identify the most climate-adapted and productive wheat varieties in lima(peru), thereby accelerating the development of genotypes best adapted todrought and heat. by engaging with regional institutions, we now seek tounderstand the impacts of improved varieties on food (nutritional andeconomic) security and wellbeing of peruvian communities.this project will test the selected resilient and high yielding wheat varietiesin the highlands. in parallel, unalm's quinoa genotypes will be selected byadapting the method to this crop, and testing with local public (inia in punoand ayacucho, unalm in junín and lima) and private (recrías américasac in arequipa) stakeholders. this dual approach encouragessubsistence and commercial activities to boost self-sufficiency andeconomic activity. agricultural economists (dra-puno, recrías américasac) and nutritionists (unsch, una-puno) will model the long-termimpacts of these new genotypes on target communities. online shortcourses and face-to-face workshops will showcase the methodology to thestakeholders' communities, while information on improved varieties will bedisseminated via open days at the trial sites, unalm's and partners' socialnetworks (twitter, facebook, etc.) and project website.;Resilience;1.0

biosphere reserves as observatories for climate change adaptation in southern africa biosphere reserves as observatories for climate change adaptation in southern africa background: climate change impacts are being observed across the southern african region, with waterrelated hazards causing massive flooding, landslides and severe droughts, significantly affecting natural resources and posing a direct threat to human security. the number of affected people has seen a sharp increase over the last decade, stressing the need for effective adaptation strategies. while climate change is driven by global processes, the solutions to offset the negative effects of climate risks are particularly dependent on local conditions. in this respect, unesco biosphere reserves (brs) have the potential to become global observatories for climate change adaptation and mitigation, as highlighted in the mab strategy 2015-2025. the project will engage a set of established and proposed brs in the region to pilot effective pathways towards climate change adaptation, using a multidisciplinary approach around four main components. by assessing the impact of climate change, brs will be established as observatories on one hand, and as pilot areas for adaptation actions. tool development for disaster risk reduction (drr) will be the focus of the second component, particularly tackling floods, droughts and landslides. communities in brs will be actively involved through education for sustainable development and citizen science to increase awareness and to support adaptation actions to strengthen the communities' resilience to climate change. regional and transboundary cooperation between brs in the region is the fourth pillar to ensure that the brs fulfil their role as pilot areas for sustainable development and climate change adaptation.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

clean, affordable and secure energy for southeast asia (case) clean, affordable and secure energy for southeast asia (case) southeast asia is one of the fastest-growing developing regions in the world, with an energy demand forecast to rise by 70% by 2040. the partner countries are currently responsible for 80% of the region's energy consumption, which, according to current planning, includes the substantial use of coal. this makes the successful implementation of the paris agreement more difficult. the project therefore supports an energy transition with ambitious climate goals in this region. together with the broad participation of relevant stakeholders, evidence-based solutions for key challenges are being developed aimed at reorienting the energy transition and the pertinent local dialogue. it also supports coordination in the energy sector in south east asia and provides technical and political assistance. the project is developing a knowledge platform and it is also participating in the regional specialist dialogue as part of the south east asian energy transition partnership (etp).;Renewable energy;1.0

climate resilience and food production in peru (cropp) (ff\1920\1\74) climate resilience and food production in peru (cropp) (ff\1920\1\74) this builds on an existing project (ff\1920\1\74). the current and future impact of climate change on agro-pastoral farming systems, and their water supplying ecosystems, remains poorly understood in the peruvian andes. this is a significant issue given the known vulnerability to climate variability and extreme weather, which is already having a significant impact on agricultural productivity, compounded by chronic poverty in many rural areas and the need for better government-led strategic planning. to address this challenge, our project aims to gain a better understanding of the difficulties faced by rural farming communities living with climate change, the opportunities afforded through appropriate adaptive strategies, and the inherent resilience of people and mountain environments to natural shocks and disasters caused by climate variability. we will also develop a model that integrates agro- economic data with climate change scenarios, and water and ecological resource quantification and analysis. these approaches will enable us to plan sustainable management practices that enhance climate resilience in conjunction with positive economic outcomes for farmers, aiding decision-makers to better understand and debate future adaptive strategies. we will undertake a fully integrated study that is collaborative and interdisciplinary drawing upon methodologies developed in the humanities, and social and natural sciences, with expertise provided by local communities, ngos, government personnel, and academic staff from the fields of archaeology, hydrology, ethnography, economics, ecology and climatology. the research will involve workshops and interviews with stakeholders, interrogation of secondary datasets, assembling climate models and meteorological data, the survey of the water management infrastructure, and the collection and analysis of hydrological and ecology data from tributary rivers and peatlands. building upon our previous research, we will focus on ancash (cordillera blanca and cordillera negra) in west-central peru, and undertake a comparison with ayacucho-apurimac (sondondo and chicha-soras) in south-central peru, where the impact of climate change is already being felt by rural communities.our funded research is developing a fuller understanding of the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on wetland ecosystems in the peruvian andes, and the role these ecosystems play in water engineering and agropastoral farming. however, through our recent wetland fieldwork and discussions with local farmers, we have recognised the need to enhance the ecohydrological study approaches to consider high precision instrumentation and modelling, two aspects that were not feasible within the original funding. the complexity of these wetland ecosystems and potential for non-linear responses (in cases abrupt drying has occurred) highlights the need for incorporating modelling approaches to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies that wil;Resilience;1.0

comparative functional genomics and microbiomes in lifestyle transition of borneo indigenous hunter-gatherer communities comparative functional genomics and microbiomes in lifestyle transition of borneo indigenous hunter-gatherer communities in indonesia, a patch of eastern bornean forest remains the home of the last active hunter-gatherer group in the region, the cave punan (punan batu), who live under karstic rock-shelters. they continue to hunt on a daily basis, primarily using dogs and spears, and to gather a range of forest tubers and fruits. however, deforestation is forcing the community to transition away from their traditional lifestyle towards a more sedentary and partially agricultural one. the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture involves a radical shift in diets and physical activity levels, and could disrupt long-standing biology likely to have been shaped by natural selection, eventually leading to increased risk for lifestyle disease. hence, the aims of this project are i) to characterize genomic adaptation to a foraging lifestyle in the cave punan, ii) to study the biological impact of lifestyle transition by observing the changes at the rna and epigenetic level in communities along this lifestyle gradient, iii) and to contrast the gut microbiome diversity in communities with different lifestyles. this study will provide insights on how our ancestors' way of life has left genomics imprint in contemporary foraging community, and how lifestyle changes would alter its biological significance.;Biodiv Conserv Prog;1.0

estimating the health co-benefits from climate action estimating the health co-benefits from climate action programme: wt/post fellowship. description: there is evidence that the global value of health co-benefits that result from climate action, are greater than the financial costs of mitigation measures around climate change. however, policy decisions at national and sub-national levels seldom reflect a connection with these global assessments. the world health organisation (who) has recognised this as an area of priority, and over the course of 2020-21 are committed to work with health economists to provide economic evidence that can be integrated into national level considerations, and specific policy measures for climate change. as a health economist, i will work with the department of environment, climate change and health at who headquarters, to support the generation of reliable country-level estimates of potential health gains and savings from national climate mitigation commitments of member countries. i will use mixed methods in my research, including cost-benefit analysis for feasible interventions and policy analysis to appreciate successful policies in neighbouring countries. the outputs of my work, which will highlight the health implications of climate change for policy-makers within and outside the health sector, will include a policy report highlighting country level health benefits due to reduced emissions, as well as a paper for submission to an academic journal.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

f.a: developing biocultural community protocols in community forestry in nepal f.a: developing biocultural community protocols in community forestry in nepal within the project members of five community forestry communities will be trained on the national and international legal context of biocultural community protocols. the same communities will document their biocultural life-heritage, develop biocultural community protocols and organize local campaigns to demand bio-cultural rights. representatives of fecofun and local communities will participate in the meetings of the un convention on biological diversity to share the experiences related to the community protocols. individual biocultural community protocols will be published at local level. in addition, fecofun will publish an evaluation report on the state of biocultural rights of local and indigenous communities to be shared at international fora. the biocultural rights of the indigenous and local communities have been recognized in many international human rights and biodiversity instruments, but because of the reluctance of the nepalese government, they are not implemented. community forestry plans based on the national forest act emphasize technical standards rather than rights, so it is necessary to produce separate biocultural protocols. at community level knowledge of international instruments such as the un biodiversity agreement is weak, so it is necessary to increase it. communities also need stronger campaigning capacity for biocultural rights to be included in forest management plans and forestry legislation. as a result of the project, the awareness of biocultural rights of local communities is expected to grow, the communities' biocultural life heritage will be documented and biocultural protocols will be drafted, government and other actors will recognize the community's cultural rights and the campaigning capacity of the community will be strengthened to defend the rights. fecofun and local community representatives will be able to effectively participate in national and international forums and share the publication with wider audiences. the beneficiaries of the project are the members of the selected five community forestry groups in the following districts: bardiya (tharu people, khata corridor), sunsari (peasants, ramdhuni cultural forest), kathmandu (tamang people, shandong national park buffer zone), rasuwa / nuwakot (tamang people, lantang national park buffer zone), dhading / gorkha (various populations, community forest adjacent to the budigandaki hydropower project). 'biocultural rights' is a concept related to the international environmental and human rights law, in which the interrelatedness of indigenous peoples' cultures and natural habitat is recognised, as well as their rights to both culture and natural resources. the interrelatedness of culture and natural habitat as the basis of the related rights is documented through biocultural community protocols.;Forest Sustainability: Tropical, Sustainable Management, Deforestation, REDD+;1.0

f.a: strengthening sustainability practices in the management of community forests in liberia – phase 2 f.a: strengthening sustainability practices in the management of community forests in liberia – phase 2 in liberia, due to the 2009 community rights law, 49 community-managed community forest areas covering more than 1 million hectares have been established. of these, 6 are mainly focused on forest conservation, 39 have commercial contracts and 4 have no defined focus. if the conservation-oriented community forests do not see the benefits of their activities, these forests are also at risk of being lost to commercial logging. in addition, community forests are in danger because of weak management capacity leading into lack of transparency and accountability.the project will promote the conservation and sustainable use of community forests by strengthening the capacity of the management bodies of the two community forests to adapt their forest management plans to the requirements of the forest authority and to implement them as required by law, as well as by building sustainable livelihood options together with the communities. through the project, communities within the community forest areas are expected to (i) achieve sustainable management practices in mapping, monitoring and evaluation of their forest resources both within and around their community forest area, (ii) improve the management of forest resources in community forest areas, including through the establishment and capacity building of management committees, (iii) through technical and financial support, communities are expected to adopt sustainable livelihood options that improve income generation opportunities.the project will benefit 275 members of the management bodies of the gba and salayea community forest areas, forest scouts and people involved in income generation activities. the indirect beneficiaries are all the inhabitants of the community forest areas concerned: 65 164 people (37 248 of whom are women). the project is implemented by the social entrepreneurs for sustainable development (https://sesdevliberia.org/ ) in partnership with the green landscapes initiatives.;Forest Sustainability: Tropical, Sustainable Management, Deforestation, REDD+;1.0

forest and environment development program forest and environment development program the forest and environmental policy development program project represents the international development association (ida) and the global environment facility (gef) contribution to a multi-donor national forest and environment sector development program, initiated and led by the government of cameroon. it will help consolidate and scale up recent successful forest sector policy reforms, support capacity-building, and strengthen forest and environment institutions, by expanding their work programs in the fields of environmental monitoring, policy oversight, law enforcement, forest management, biodiversity conservation, and community-based forest activities. given the concentration of poverty in rural areas (where most o f the poor live, and where 64 percent of all inhabitants are poor), the hardship and low wages typical of forest employment, and the forest's role as the principal source of cash income for the rural poor - the operation is self-targeting on the poor. through its focus on sectoral policy, institutional reform, law enforcement, regulation of forest production and environmental monitoring, rehabilitation of degraded national parks and biodiversity conservation sites, the project will have a strong positive impact on the environment. however, the project carries significant risks associated with political and financial sustainability. for the bank, there are also fiduciary risks. nonetheless, the project integrates comprehensive measures to address or mitigate each risk: it is designed and sequenced to build institutional capacity to effectively address these risks. given the bank's considerable involvement in sector reforms over the past several years in cameroon, any potential downside associated with inaction would far outweigh the risks associated with the operation itself.;Forest Sustainability: Tropical, Sustainable Management, Deforestation, REDD+;1.0

harvesting the sun twice: enhancing livelihoods in east african agricultural communities through innovations in solar energy harvesting the sun twice: enhancing livelihoods in east african agricultural communities through innovations in solar energy access to energy is a widespread problem across east africa, where 73% of the population still do not have reliable electricity. proving secure and affordable energy infrastructure is crucial to promoting inclusive development of rural communities in this region, and solar power is a sustainable way of achieving this. however, ground mounted arrays of solar panels also remove land from food production at a time when crop yields are threatened by a changing climate and increasing populations, insecure ownership and land 'grabbing' are putting pressure on land resources. in practice, economic growth linked to conventional solar arrays may be outweighed by reduced income from crop production and greater food insecurity. renewable energy technologies which resolve energy, climate and land security conflicts are urgently needed. so called agrivoltiac (av) systems permit the delivery of solar electricity, crop production, and rainwater harvesting on the same land area. instead of being ground mounted, arrays are several meters high, enabling crops to be grown underneath. in locations with high light intensity, high temperature, and low rainfall, such as many places in east africa, the productivity of crops grown beneath these elevated solar arrays can be significantly improved because shade from the panels creates a more favourable growing environment with reduced heat stress and water loss. this more favourable environment for plants means the range of crops can be extended to higher-value ones, which can improve farmer incomes in disadvantaged rural communities. crops may also be grown in locations previously unsuitable, further increasing food supplies and revenue sources. working with african solar developers and a kenyan agribusiness company, as well as non-governmental organisations, regional political organisations and local communities, we have identified case study sites in kenya and uganda where solar arrays are being installed and our interdisciplinary research can be conducted. the project aims to provide a real test case for the application and adaptation of av systems to the needs of communities in eastern africa by: a) identifying areas in kenya, uganda and tanzania that are most physically suitable (e.g. climate, existing land use, lack of energy access) for realising the benefits of av systems and their uptake by communities. b) field testing of av systems in communities in kenya & uganda to provide data on resulting livelihood enhancement (increasing crop yield and farmer income, access to sustainable energy) as well as perceptions and attitudes of rural communities to av systems. c) using the data collected to develop a decision support tool for regional and national governments and ngos to deliver av systems effectively and in line with community needs. the findings from this project will reveal the potential this technology to lead to livelihood improved access to energy and increased incomes through production of higher-value crop;Renewable energy;1.0

measuring adaptation progress in the agricultural sector (map ag) measuring adaptation progress in the agricultural sector (map ag) the paris agreement on climate change established the global goal on adaptation to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, and reduce vulnerability to climate change. it also called for the periodic assessment of progress in achieving the global goal on adaptation (referred to as the global stock take on adaptation). the nationally determined contributions of 80% of developing countries have identified agriculture as an area requiring adaptation and mitigation actions, making this sector one of the most critical in addressing climate change.   as the need to adapt to a changing climate becomes increasingly apparent, tools and guidance are needed to assess the value of different adaptation pathways. to date, there are no universally accepted metrics to measure collective progress on adaptation in the agricultural sector. there is also a general lack of tools and methods for assessing adaptation progress in the context of the global goal on adaptation.   this project aims to improve understanding of the global goal on adaptation and the ability to assess adaptation progress by providing knowledge and information on the effectiveness of adaptation actions in the agricultural sector. the research team will develop tools and a framework for tracking adaptation progress in the agricultural sector and will then apply these frameworks, tools, and knowledge to inform policy, negotiations, and practice. the project is expected to enhance understanding and improve the assessment of collective adaptation progress. a multi-stakeholder forum (annual global adaptation forum) will be held to share knowledge and experiences that promote ownership of the solutions and that inform global, regional, national, and local climate change policies and initiatives.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

multi-country investment climate program multi-country investment climate program the multi-country investment climate program (mcicp) supports investment climate reform advisory in a total of 20 seco partner countries. it is implemented by the international finance corporation (ifc), a globally recognized leader in this field. there is broad consensus about the relevance of investment climate (ic) reform. worldwide, private companies account for more than 90% of job creation and represent a major source of economic growth. their ability to grow and reduce poverty depends critically on a well-functioning ic: simple, clear and transparent regulations create a level playing field for small- and medium enterprises (smes), increase competition and spur innovation. furthermore, an improved ic reduces various costs for firms, triggers additional investments and can lead to job creation. despite progress, the ic is an ongoing challenge in seco's countries of intervention.;Green Growth Strategies;1.0

nikola tesla thermal plant b (tent b): modernisation of the monitoring and control system nikola tesla thermal plant b (tent b): modernisation of the monitoring and control system the project proposed by elektroprivreda srbije (eps) consists of the replacement and the upgrading of the monitoring and control system (mcs) of the  nikola tesla b  thermal power plant (tent b) commissioned in 1985 (unit b1 1983, unit b2 1985) and currently producing one fifth of serbia's energy with 2x620 mw 3 stages steam turbines. the total budget of the project, estimated on the basis of budget offers, is 28.6 mchf. eps, the end beneficiary, is prepared to co-finance the project to a level of 63% (18.04 mchf) of the value of the project, seco's share is 37% (10.56 mchf). this costs split results from a preliminarily agreed 50% minimum serbian contribution, from seco's budget frame for serbia and from the project's scope and structure. eps' financing will be provided from internal funding. eps's financial projection for the year 2007 shows a loss, but according to the eps business plan 2006-10, a moderate profit will be made in the coming years. the investment scheduled for tent b will not affect the sustainability of eps. seco's grant contribution to the project is justified for the following reasons: (a) impact on eps' investment schedule for energy efficiency and environmental projects. the grant has a clear trigger effect. (b) the grant allows a swiss technology transfer to eps in a timely moment. (c) eps has only limited access to other sources of financing, considering that the project is only marginally economically viable. the project will be implemented under the agreement of technical, financial and humanitarian cooperation between serbia and switzerland signed on 21.02.2003. it is fully in line with the cooperation strategy for serbia and the internal country strategy note. a project trilateral agreement (ta) will be concluded between seco, the ministry of energy and mining and eps, based on the model of the national control center project agreement (project implemented by eps), which covered the previous infrastructure project in serbia. reasons for the replacement are clearly the equipment's age and its subsequent financial and ecological costs: the system is now fully outdated in respect of its reliability and performance. the pollution emissions (sox, nox, co2, ashes) are increased because of sub-optimal operating conditions. the risk of outage due to a breakdown and to the unavailability of spare parts has increased in the recent years.;Geothermal Explr/Plants;1.0

programa de adaptación climatico programa de adaptación climatico le pérou est le troisième pays le plus menacé au monde par les conséquences du changement climatique. le ministère de l'environnement péruvien (minam) a élaboré une stratégie nationale d'adaptation au changement climatique (une de ses trois priorités) et a sollicité l'appui de la ddc, en raison de son expérience en développement économique local dans les andes. identifié conjointement avec le minam et les gouvernements régionaux de cusco et d'apurimac, culminant par un atelier avec large participation publique, le programme d'adaptation au changement climatique a comme finalité de contribuer à consolider les conditions de vie des communautés dans les régions andines de cusco et apurimac en réduisant la vulnérabilité - surtout des couches sociales défavorisées - face aux conséquences du changement climatique. ce programme s'insère clairement dans la logique du nouveau message pour la coopération de mars 2008, contribuant à l'axe prioritaire 1 (objectif du millénaire 1 : réduction de la pauvreté), à l'axe 2 (promotion de la sécurité humaine par réduction de la vulnérabilité aux effets du changement climatique) et à l'axe 3 (mondialisation propice au développement).. le pacc est innovateur dans son montage institutionnel: c'est un projet du gouvernement national, exécuté par les gouvernements régionaux, avec l'appui financier de la ddc, le soutien d'un consortium d'ongs (intercooperation, libelula et predes) pour sa mise en œuvre, ainsi qu'une composante scientifique (universités suisses et péruviennes) pour son pilotage stratégique. les résultats attendus du pacc à l'horizon 2011-2012 sont au nombre de quatre: 1. connaître la vulnérabilité - les régions de cusco et apurimac ont développé des diagnostics et dressé la liste des conditions d'adaptation au changement climatique avec la participation des populations affectées, de leurs autorités et d'institutions spécialisées. 2. mesurer et informer - un système régional d'information publique sur le changement climatique et ses effets est établi et validé par les autorités. 3. agir dans des districts choisis - des mesures d'adaptation priorisées sont mises en œuvre dans des districts sélectionnés dans chacune des deux régions. 4. apprendre et influencer les politiques publiques - le thème de l'adaptation au changement climatique est bien présent dans les politiques publiques, aux trois niveaux : pays, régions et municipalités rurales, en s'inspirent des expériences générées par le pacc. le pacc interviendra dans deux régions andines priorisées par la coopération suisse : cusco et apurimac, dotées de niveaux élevés de pauvreté rurale. le pacc pourra donc bénéficier des solides expériences récoltées par la ddc dans le domaine du développement rural durable. pour renforcer encore l'impact du pacc sur les politiques régionales comme nationale, la ddc soutiendra activement le processus de coordination de l'aide extérieure en relation avec le changement climatique, qui est encore jeune au pérou. le choix des;Climate Adaptation;1.0

puesta en marcha de un sistema efectivo de gestión y control de los recursos forestales en la región de oio (guinea bissau) puesta en marcha de un sistema efectivo de gestión y control de los recursos forestales en la región de oio (guinea bissau) el consumo energético de guinea bissau depende en gran medida de los recursos forestales leñosos disponibles. el patrimonio forestal presenta dificultades ligadas a la extracción descontrolada de los recursos madereros, a cambios climáticos, y a las prácticas culturales aun ligadas a agricultura extensiva, quemadas, producción de carbón, por tanto, estas acciones han originado disminuciones forestales del orden de 625.000 m³/ano. la mayoría de las poblaciones (85 a 95%) utiliza leña y carbón para cocinar y otras necesidades energéticas debido a la débil producción de energía eléctrica y a la casi inexistencia de uso de gas butano. actualmente el consumo unitario se sitúa alrededor de 666 kg/habitante/año con un aumento del 8,3% al año. esto significa el equivalente a una corta anual de 15.000 ha de bosques. la falta de planificación forestal, de formación y recursos técnicos de los equipos técnicos de la dirección general de bosques y fauna (dgff) y la ausencia de un sistema de información forestal, hacen complicada una correcta gestión de los recursos forestales. desde la década de los 80 no se realiza un inventario general de los recursos forestales por lo que es aún más difícil el conocimiento del estado actual de los bosques en guinea bissau. el objetivo general del proyecto es contribuir a la sostenibilidad ambiental del país como estrategia de mitigación de los efectos del cambio climático y sus implicaciones ambientales, sociales y económicas. el objetivo específico de la acción es la puesta en marcha de un sistema efectivo de gestión y control de los recursos forestales en la región de oio. de esta manera se proveerá a la dgff de herramientas para mejorar la gestión a través de un mejor soporte de información forestal que permita la adecuada toma de decisiones. la dgff como órgano fiscalizador mejorará sus recursos técnicos para intensificar el control sobre los recursos forestales y poder así definir mejores estrategias para solventar el problema de la degradación forestal.;Forest Sustainability: Tropical, Sustainable Management, Deforestation, REDD+;1.0

regional institutional capacity building in climate change regional institutional capacity building in climate change according to the world development report 2010 from the world bank, as a result of the impacts of climate change (cc), developing countries bear most of the damage costs, which involve about 75% to 80%. according to the report, a warming of 2 degrees celsius can result in significant reductions in annual per capita income in developing countries. adequately address climate change, then, is one of the biggest public policy challenges facing the region. the answer, that is urgent now more than ever, requires new knowledge and approaches, which must necessarily be multidisciplinary and cross-sectiorial and comprehensively address the impacts on populations, pollution of water sources, deforestation, the increasing levels of urbanization and poverty and the effects of natural disasters. the answer depends on a deep understanding of the relationship between climate change and economic development, social and environmental, as well as the existence of conditions, economic, social and institutional, so that the necessary policies may be put into execution. this kcp aims to support countries in the region to generate, to obtain, to share and to disseminate that knowledge.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

restoration of functional tropical landscapes through agroforestry systems restoration of functional tropical landscapes through agroforestry systems establishing a biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (bef) experiment in the bolivian andes. there is compelling evidence for positive effects of plant diversity on the functioning of forests and agroecosystems. this information is increasingly used to optimize production systems that provide a wide range of ecosystem services. at the same time, the demand for forest restoration is growing as the potential roles of forest plantations in sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity are recognized. agroforestry uses the diversity of plant life-forms to maintain multiple ecosystem functions, and bears a large potential to facilitate forest restoration. in addition, it allows landowners to overcome financial obstacles associated with restoration. while agroforestry is actively promoted for the restoration of degraded landscapes, there is a paucity of knowledge on biodiversity ecosystem functioning (bef) relationships in agroforestry systems. this highlights the need for a new type of experiments in agroforestry to advance our understanding of the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning. the goal of the proposed project is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of tree crop interactions in af systems to enable prediction of suitable combinations of trees and crops, which facilitate the restoration of ecosystem functioning in tropical forest landscapes. this is a timely topic given that both the restoration of tropical forests by planting native tree species and bef experiments are being promoted around the world with little consideration of assembling species based on functional traits. therefore, we propose to analyze the interactions of different growth forms among plants in agroforestry systems based on their morphological and physiological traits. for that purpose, we propose to set-up the world's first bef-experiment in the field of agroforestry. this project breaks new ground as our experimental design incorporates strict methodological principles used by bef-experiments and at the same time was developed together with land managers.;Forest Sustainability: Tropical, Sustainable Management, Deforestation, REDD+;1.0

samarkand solar power project samarkand solar power project the proposed samarkand solar power project (the project) aims to increase renewable energy generation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) in uzbekistan. the project has two main components: (i) construction of a 100 megawatt (mw) grid-connected crystalline photovoltaic (pv) power plant with single axis tracking system, (ii) institutional capacity building on solar energy and grid integration, and (iii) project management and supervision.uzbekistan has among the highest energy and carbon intensities in the world, both over six times the world average, calling for drastic increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce ghg emissions. despite the huge potential, renewable energy supplies less than 11% of the country?s power demand, and only hydro resources are being tapped. over 89% of uzbekistan?s 12.6 gigawatts (gw) of installed capacity are conventional thermal power plants fueled by natural gas (76%), fuel oil (7%), and coal (6%). half of this fossil-based energy is generated in power plants built before 1982, with only 10% generated in power plants built after 1997. moreover, total grid losses is about 20%, due in part to long distance transmission and distribution. while uzbekistan is almost 100% electrified, the demand?supply gap leaves many provinces, including samarkand, with intermittent power. in addition, the domestic consumption of gas equals lost export revenues, estimated at over $900 million for 2012 alone. the project?s impact is improved sustainability of the energy supply in uzbekistan, and the outcome is increased renewable energy generation in uzbekistan. the project has two main outputs: (i) construction of a 100 mw on-grid crystalline pv power plant, transmission and support facilities, and (ii) capacity building, project management and supervision support for uzbekenergo.;Solar PV Energy;1.0

community based adaptation in africa (cbaa) community based adaptation in africa (cbaa) this project proposes to carry out climate change adaptation pilot projects in communities in eight african countries, six of which are least developed countries. the communities will be selected in collaboration with relevant actors, particularly meteorological services, using the south-south-north adaptation project protocol (ssnapp), a methodology used for mapping vulnerability to climate change. the projects, implemented by nongovernmental organizations, will take a learning-by-doing approach, identifying ways of communicating climate change information to poor communities, and from communities to other stakeholders. the lessons learned will be shared with stakeholders at the local, national, regional and international levels, and inform ongoing initiatives promoting climate change adaptation and sustainable development.;Climate Adaptation;1.0
integrating indigenous knowledge in climate risk management to support community based adaptation integrating indigenous knowledge in climate risk management to support community based adaptation traditionally, african farmers have used indigenous knowledge to understand weather and climate patterns and make decisions about crop and irrigation cycles. however, increased variability associated with climate change has reduced their confidence in traditional knowledge. scientific weather forecasts, on the other hand, are formulated on a much larger scale and are presented in a manner unfamiliar to farmers. this creates a dilemma for those who recognize the limitations of traditional climate forecasts but are unable to use scientific ones. to address this problem, researchers will endeavor to integrate indigenous knowledge into scientific climate forecasts at the local level, where it can be used to enhance the resilience of communities vulnerable to climate change. the project will be carried out in nganyi community in western kenya, an area that is known to have a well-established system of traditional weather forecasting.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

developing strategies for adaptation of rural communities to climate change in the illimani watershed (bolivian andes) developing strategies for adaptation of rural communities to climate change in the illimani watershed (bolivian andes) the andes account for more than 98% of the world's tropical mountain glaciers. rural communities in nearby villages use glacier water for domestic consumption and agricultural production. now, however, rapid retreat of the glaciers, triggered by climate change, is threatening the water supply of such communities. given the pace at which the glaciers are retreating, there is an urgent need to look for alternative sources of water.''the illimani glacier is close to the cities of la paz and el alto and has been identified as a potential new source of water. however, water availability in the illimani watershed is already decreasing as the rural population engages in the production of more profitable agricultural crops such as fruits and vegetables to meet the urban demand. diverting water to la paz and el alto would drastically reduce water availability in the watershed, affect food production and potentially trigger conflict between urban and rural populations.''this grant will strengthen the capacity of local communities and authorities to devise a mid-to-long-term strategy for adapting to climate change in the illimani watershed. using scientific evidence from glaciology, hydrology and agronomy, researchers will assess the evolution and prepare a model of  water supply and demand in the region. taking into consideration indigenous knowledge and local risk mitigation strategies, they will identify ways of minimizing conflict over water resources with local stakeholders. the results will inform long-term decision-making regarding water in the cities of la paz and el alto.;Climate Adaptation;1.0

african research partnerships through the africa health systems initiative / partenariats de recherche africains grâce à l'initiative sur les systèmes de santé en afrique health personnel development the project aims to support research partnerships between african and canadian researchers to find solutions to africa's human resources crisis and to strengthen health systems in africa. the africa health systems initiative support to african research partnerships's (ahsi-res) objective is to demonstrate a clear link between research, policy, and action to improve the health outcomes of the most vulnerable populations of the region.   to date, ten funded teams were selected from over fifty proposals following a rigorous merit review process. they are co-led by an african researcher and a decision-maker from three african regions: west africa (burkina faso, mali), east africa (kenya, tanzania, uganda), and southern africa (malawi, zambia). their research focuses on two main areas: 1) the recruitment and retention of health workers and the shift of certain services to less specialized health workers in response to a severe human resources crisis in the health sector in sub-saharan africa, and 2) the role of health information in ensuring greater equity in access to health care.   the ahsi-res is the research component of the african health systems initiative (ahsi), a ten-year, $450-million commitment (2006-2016) to strengthen health systems in sub-saharan africa.   this project is implemented by canada's global health research initiative (ghri), hosted at the international development research centre (idrc). ghri is an established collaborative mechanism comprised of five canadian agencies: cida, idrc, health canada, the public health agency of canada and the canadian institutes of health research. / ce projet supporte des partenariats de recherche entre des chercheurs africains et canadiens afin de trouver des solutions à la crise des ressources humaines en afrique et aux problématiques majeures qui touchent les systèmes de santé en afrique. le support aux ''partenariats de recherche africains grâce à l'initiative sur les systèmes de santé en afrique'' vise à renforcer les systèmes de santé en faisant la démonstration qu'il existe un lien clair entre la recherche, les politiques et les programmes de santé, et ce dans le but d'améliorer l'état de santé des populations les plus vulnérables de la région.   à ce jour, 10 équipes de recherche provenant de trois régions : afrique de l'ouest (burkina faso, mali), afrique de l'est (kenya, tanzanie et ouganda) et afrique du sud (malawi, zambie) ont été sélectionné parmi plus de 50 candidatures suivant un processus rigoureux d'examen du mérite. chaque équipe est dirigée conjointement par un chercheur et un décideur africains. les recherches portent sur deux aspects principaux : 1) le recrutement et la rétention de ressources humaines pour la santé et le transfert de certains services à des travailleurs moins spécialisés en réponse à l'importante crise des ressources humaines en santé en afrique sub-saharienne et 2) le rôle de l'information en santé pour assurer davantage d'équité dans l'accès aux soins de santé.   ahsi-res est la composante recherche de l'initiative sur les systèmes de santé en afrique (issa), un engagement du canada d'une valeur de 450 millions sur une période de 10 ans (2006-2010) dont l'objectif est de renforcer les systèmes de santé en afrique sub-saharienne.   ce projet est mis en oeuvre par l'initiative de recherche en santé mondiale (irsm) du canada, dont le secrétariat est administré par le centre de recherches pour le développement international (crdi). l'irsm est un partenariat de 5 agences canadiennes : l'acdi, le crdi, santé canada, l'agence canadienne de santé publique et les instituts de recherche en santé du canada.;Health workforce, Uganda, system strengthening;0.0

biofortification of cassava biofortification of cassava cassava is one of the most important crops in the tropics with a remarkable tolerance to drought and ability to grow on poor soils. however, it has relatively low nutritional quality having dire implications for millions of people dependent on this staple crop. particularly problematic is the low ß-carotene level, which can lead to provitamin a deficiency with severe health and economic consequences, including early mortality, impaired physical ability and blindness. efforts to breed for varieties with increased b-carotene have therefore been undertaken, but is difficult to combine with high starch content, which is a vital trait for farmers's acceptance and the market value.  here we propose a new exploratory approach by cross-species comparative genomics and molecular network analysis in combination with functional testing by genetic transformation and the emerging technique of genome editing. we do this by generating transcript, smallrna and metabolite data of specific varieties with different genetic background and ß-carotene content to identify new candidate genes and key enzymes leading to increased ß-carotene levels and sustained starch content. we will also identify molecular signatures associated to these traits to screen existing germplasms for more lines to be incorporated in breeding programs. the findings will serve either for marker assisted breeding or as engineering approach by gene-editing to overcome possible constrains in traditional breeding.;Outlier Topic;0.0

bridging the know-do gap among healthcare workers and decision-makers through improved routine measurement of the quality of maternal and newborn care bridging the know-do gap among healthcare workers and decision-makers through improved routine measurement of the quality of maternal and newborn care progress in maternal, newborn and child health (mnch) outcomes in low-income countries has been slow. in tanzania, recent data suggest that although significant progress has been made in increasing coverage of essential services, the paucity of data on quality of care is a major impediment to the achievement of the desired progress in mnch outcomes.through the proposed synergy project, the researchers will build on insights gained from their ongoing imcha project (#108020) to develop and validate a novel electronic tool for measuring the quality of maternal and newborn care. they will integrate the tool into the existing health management information system (hmis) in tanzania, generate evidence on how a gender and equity perspective can be integrated in the routine assessment of quality of care, and identify the critical factors required for the scale-up and integration of the electronic tool into routine use. this project will build on the existing partnership between ifakara health institute (tanzania), sick kids centre for global health (canada) and the tanzania ministry of health. the proposed project is closely aligned with several tanzania government led strategies to improve maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes, including the big results now (brn) initiative. the project is also closely aligned with the government of canada's feminist international assistance policy , the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 who led global strategy for women, children and adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development. it is part of the innovating for maternal and child health in africa (imcha) initiative (2014-2020), a cad 36 million multi-donor partnership funded by global affairs canada, the canadian institutes of health research, and canada's international development research centre.;MNCH mortality care;0.0

building leadership for lac cities in a changing climate building leadership for lac cities in a changing climate as a result of climate change, population growth, and rapid unplanned urbanization, cities in developing countries are both the main trigger of climate change and the appropriate space for the implementation of solutions. currently, medium-sized cities face various types of disturbances associated with climate change. these range from natural disasters to social instability, all of which occur in a complex context of uncertainty and conflict. in the latin american and caribbean (lac) region, the authorities in affected cities lack reliable information and tools to deal effectively with climate change and its social consequences. the current higher education system does not offer any professional or technical degree course to meet this demand.   this 48-month leadership program aims to develop multiple technical capacities among young leaders in the region, particularly women. it is one of three leadership programs implemented by idrc's climate change program in latin america, the caribbean, africa, and asia. it consists of a postgraduate diploma that combines a theoretical training module with practical exercises to consolidate acquired knowledge in the field. it focuses on providing young leaders with practical knowledge of climate risk and urban management, accompanied by participatory planning and negotiation skills. this will enable them to advise local public and private stakeholders on the effective development of climate-resilient, transformative policies in medium-sized cities.   among the main expected results of the program are an open-access digital knowledge platform accessible on the internet, and a minimum of 75 graduates (65 % of them women) trained in climate change, risk and disaster management, governance, and conflict prevention. a minimum of 10 case studies and five technical papers will be produced and disseminated among local policymakers to help them achieve consensus-based solutions for socio-environmental conflicts caused by climate change. five city plans will be prepared to inform local authorities, and a partnership agreement will be struck with regional and international city networks for the scaling up of results.  the outcomes of the program will also represent a contribution to the implementation of the 2015 paris agreement, the 2016 new urban agenda, and goal 11 of the 2015 sustainable development goals. the program will be administered by the latin american faculty of social sciences (flacso) in ecuador, in collaboration with a number of associated latin american academic partners.;Outlier Topic;0.0

cameroon - emergency response - care canada 2016 / cameroun - réponse d'urgence - care canada 2016 cameroon - emergency response - care canada 2016 / cameroun - réponse d'urgence - care canada 2016 february 2016 - the humanitarian situation in cameroon's far north region deteriorated significantly through 2015 as boko haram violence increasingly spilled across the nigerian border. the resulting influx of over 60,000 nigerian refugees and the internal displacement of over 150,000 people is placing growing pressure on what was already the poorest and most vulnerable region of cameroon. the number of people needing food assistance in 2016 nearly doubled from 2015, rising from 1 to 2 million, while acute malnutrition rates in the far north are at emergency levels. growing insecurity has also constrained the ability of humanitarian actors to reach those most in need of assistance.   with dfatd's support, care canada is helping to assist up to 17,000 vulnerable conflict-affected people in cameroon's far north region. project activities include: (1) building/rehabilitating 28 water points, (2) building 400 latrines, (3) distributing non-food items benefitting up to 11,250 people, and (3) distributing hygiene kits benefitting up to 12,000 people. / février 2016 - la situation humanitaire dans la région de l'extrême nord du cameroun s'est détériorée de manière considérable tout au long de 2015, alors que la violence de boko haram s'est propagée de plus en plus au-delà de la frontière nigériane. l'afflux de plus de 60 000 réfugiés nigérians et le déplacement interne de plus de 150 000 personnes exercent une pression croissante sur la région, qui était déjà la plus pauvre et la plus vulnérable du cameroun. le nombre de personnes ayant besoin d'aide alimentaire en 2016 a presque doublé depuis 2015, passant de 1 à 2 millions, tandis que les taux de malnutrition aigue dans l'extrême nord sont à des niveaux d'urgence. l'insécurité grandissante a également limité la capacité des intervenants humanitaires d'atteindre ceux qui ont le plus besoin d'aide.   avec le soutien du maecd, care canada contribue à aider jusqu'à 17 000 personnes vulnérables touchées par le conflit dans la région de l'extrême nord du cameroun. les activités de projet comprennent ce qui suit : 1) la construction ou la réhabilitation de 28 points d'eau, 2) la construction de 400 latrines, 3) la distribution de produits non alimentaires pour au plus 11 250 personnes, 3) la distribution de trousses d'hygiène pour au plus 12 000 personnes.;Outlier Topic;0.0

coderuc - appui technique au cdf coderuc - appui technique au cdf project description: coderuc - appui technique au cdf   approved as an additional, complementary component alongside our contribution to a dutch program of labour intensive local development, this project aims to provide technical assistance to strengthen the capacities of the common development fund (cdf) within the ministry responsible for decentralization. this project was originally intended to target the cdf's capacities to coordinate and manage the gor's own labour intensive local development program - the ''programme de développement local à haute intensité de main d'oeuvre'' (pdl-himo), located within the cdf and still under development with cida support at the time this project was being planned. the pdl-himo has since evolved into a program with a smaller scope than originally intended, managed alongside 2 other programs currently managed by the cdf. these 3 programs within the cdf are managed according to common procedures, and they all contribute to rural development and poverty reduction through support for priority projects and programs as identified in local development plans. given this evolution, the ta support provided will be based on identified needs and could address the cdf's organizational, administrative and/or programmatic capacities.expected impact: ·  réduction de la pauvreté ·  économie rurale locale plus dynamique et diversifiéeexpected outcomes: ·  le cdf finance, coordonne et suit efficacement la mise en oeuvre du pdl-himo.expected outputs: 1 - accroissement des capacités du cdf par des appuis à la coordination et au suivi.countries: rwanda (100%)  sectors: 015140 (100%)  themes: poverty reduction, good governance, capacity development, gender equality, environment;Outlier Topic;0.0

contested elections and street politics. comparing protest coalitions in sub-saharan africa contested elections and street politics. comparing protest coalitions in sub-saharan africa over the last decade, political governance in the global south has increasingly taken the shape of electoral authoritarianism - political systems that are neither truly democratic nor fully authoritarian. in these systems, incumbents typically seek to remain in power by manipulating electoral frameworks. on the african continent, such efforts have frequently been met by protests that have taken many forms. in spite of the growing occurrence of both autocratic electoral manipulation and popular protests, the significant issue of the dynamics and scope of protest mobilisation is understudied. this project analyses when and why disparate and temporary protest movements evolve into cohesive coalitions and how this affects the ability of protest movements to achieve their aims. the project will investigate this question in four selected countries: burkina faso, burundi, kenya and uganda, in order to develop theoretically informed comparisons. this multidisciplinary project draws on expertise from anthropology and political science. through its multidisciplinary approach and comparative design, the project contributes to theoretical and methodological development as well as empirical knowledge in the fields of electoral authoritarianism and popular protests.;Electoral Processes UNDP;0.0

cordoba foundation of geneva: religiously inspired political actors and peaceful co-existence in the sahel cordoba foundation of geneva: religiously inspired political actors and peaceful co-existence in the sahel during 2013 and 2014, the cordoba foundation of geneva (cfg), together with the swiss government, has carried out a number of initiatives focused on religious actors in the sahel region. based on its work so far, the cfg maintains that polarizations and tensions occurring at the intersection of religion and politics and/or involving religiously-inspired political actors are obstacles to inclusive, participative and peaceful societies in the sahel region. in this context, the proposed project aims to revitalize intra-islamic dialogue in chad, to promote peaceful coexistence between communities of different ethnic, cultural and religious affiliation in mali, and to encourage the development of cross-regional understanding and exchange on issues impacting the promotion of peace in the region, and regional cooperation on peace initiatives, through the development of a sahel regional platform.;Outlier Topic;0.0
cordoba foundation: workshop  promoting constructive political participation beyond party politics and furthering peaceful coexistence cordoba foundation: workshop  promoting constructive political participation beyond party politics and furthering peaceful coexistence the goal of the third edition of this workshop is to encourage or consolidate political participation of faith-based political actors by creating a safe space for exchanging experiences of peaceful ways of political  survival  under authoritarian regimes or contexts where the margin of political participation is very limited. the theory of change underlying this project is the informed assumption that political participation of salafi actors could be consolidated by indicating through diverse arab and western practical experiences that  politics does not limit to party politics and that it is possible to engage with the public sphere through other means than party mechanisms (such as parliaments).;Outlier Topic;0.0

documentary: school days. documentary: school days. considerando la complementariedad que existe entre educación, cultura y desarrollo, queremos utilizar el soporte audiovisual para reforzar la calidad de la educación dirigida a la población infantil. estamos convencidos que la educación primaria sienta las bases del futuro, y que una educación básica de calidad mejora los factores de desarrollo y la calidad de vida de la población, pero tenemos que reconocer que lograr atender a todos los niños y niñas nicaragüenses en edad escolar con una educación de calidad que les permita prepararse para la vida y el trabajo aún presenta importantes retos y desafíos. la escasez de recurso de la mayoría de la población, la falta de presupuesto destinado a la educación y la formación precaria de los docente son los principales obstáculos a una enseñanza sólida. para entender estas dificultadas, profundizar la reflexión y discusión y contribuir a aportar soluciones mediante la observación y el testimonio audiovisual, decidimos compartir un año escolar con los alumnos de una escuela rural. escogimos implantarnos en el núcleo de educación rural de fe y alegría, por ser un proyecto único y completo que brinda educación a una población rural empobrecida desde el preescolar hasta el bachillerato. está formado por 9 escuelas, siendo 6 de ellas escuelas multigrados, y cuenta también con una escuela normal. con la misma línea de trabajo que estamos impulsando desde hace varios años, estaremos filmando la progresión de las niñas y los niños en su aprendizaje con un enfoque sensible y humano que permita una análisis constructiva de las situaciones, logros, y dificultadas encontradas. estaremos trabajando en estrecha colaboración con el núcleo de educación rural de fe y alegría en lechecuagos, los educadores, los padres de familia, los alumnos y la comunidad en general. el documental una vez terminado será ampliamente difundido en la comunidad, los centros educativos de fe y alegría a través del país y las escuelas publicas. permitirá generar un debate entre los diferentes actores de la sociedad sobre la escuela. servirá de herramienta para la formación de los futuros maestros en la escuela normal del centro experimental la asunción perteneciendo al núcleo educativo rural de lechecuagos. la universidad centroamericana (uca) coordina y acredita desde 2006 este programa piloto y docentes perteneciendo a la facultad de humanidades y comunicación son los tutores de los futuros egresados de la escuela normal. lo consideran desde ahora como un instrumento de formación et de evaluación valioso para la sistematización del programa. la fundación libros para niños también está asociada a este proyecto cuenta difundir el documental en el marco de sus actividades de sensibilización a la lectura y al aprendizaje.;Education workshops Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua;0.0

ending violence against women: program implementation ending violence against women: program implementation ending violence against women and girls at home, in their communities and in disaster and conflict situations is one of the four pillars of australia's gender equality strategy. this strategy highlights that a more strategic and targeted focus is needed in areas where progress has been slow and that the highest levels of expenditure will be in the countries with the most severe gender gaps. cambodia meets this criterion as it ranks 99 out of 145 countries in the gender inequality index (gii) of the 2011 human development report (hdr), which is one of the lowest rankings in the region. the program will work with the ministry of women's affairs (mowa) of the royal government of cambodia (rgc), the ministries of interior and justice (through ccjap) and cambodian civil society to deliver a comprehensive response to vaw. in the short term, we will: support the development of a new national action plan on violence against women (napvaw) that is fully costed, evidence based, and developed in consultation with communities, survivors of violence, civil society organisations (cso) and whole of government, to identify a comprehensive and coordinated  response to vaw, and b)  support a prevalence study that will ensure resources are well targeted need. in the medium term (july-december) the program will undertake a joint design with un women to: 1)  identify the best modality for civil society support for providing victim assistance services, legal aid,  advocacy and community awareness/behaviour change, and 2)  assess the feasibility of integrating the legal enforcement aspects of the napvaw into the new phase of assistance to the justice sector), and longer term we will have: i)  an agreement with un women to manage a civil society program window, and  ii)  integrated feasible components of napvaw into the 2013 ccjap annual plans, leveraging additional funding to make real improvements. the total value of this initiative is $15.7million over 5 years, starting 2011-12.;Gender-based Violence Prevention/Response;0.0

fid - des drones pour faciliter la livraison de médicaments dans les régions reculées fid - des drones pour faciliter la livraison de médicaments dans les régions reculées le contexte :jusqu'à un tiers des centres de santé publique, desservant 20 % de la population, sont inaccessibles par la route pendant tout ou partie de l'année à madagascar. l'une des principales conséquences est que les ruptures de stock de médicaments essentiels sont plus fréquentes dans les zones éloignées des districts qui centralisent les approvisionnements et l'offre de soins.pour ces raisons, les communautés diminuent leurs attentes à l'égard des services publics et sont nombreuses à renoncer aux soins de santé. les femmes concernées par les problématiques de santé maternelle et reproductive et les enfants de moins de 5 ans sont les premiers à être touchés par cette réalité.l'innovation :le projet développé par psi (population services international) prévoit de livrer des produits sur le « dernier kilomètre » et ainsi d'améliorer la chaîne d'approvisionnement vers 150 établissements de santé malgaches difficiles d'accès, par l'usage de drones qui viendront compléter le transport terrestre afin d'améliorer les chaînes d'approvisionnement existantes.en reliant les pharmacies de district aux centres de santé les plus reculés, le projet vise à étendre l'impact des investissements nationaux dans les infrastructures de soins au bénéfice des communautés les plus vulnérables.une équipe de recherche sera en charge de collecter et d'analyser les informations générées par le déploiement des drones. des enquêtes qualitatives seront menées pour mesurer la disponibilité des produits et les résultats observés en termes de santé au niveau individuel d'une part, et l'utilisation des services dans les établissements de santé d'autre part. une étude coût-efficacité permettra d'examiner les coûts de l'utilisation des véhicules aériens sans pilote pour le système de santé ainsi que pour les bénéficiaires.le gouvernement, à travers le ministère de la santé publique, sera impliqué tout au long du projet, de la conception à l'évaluation des résultats. un comité technique sera ainsi formé, composé des fonctionnaires du niveau central et des districts, des donateurs et du secteur privé avec le double objectif de plaider pour un modèle mixte de financement de la technologie et, à terme, de transférer la responsabilité opérationnelle de l'utilisation des drones au gouvernement malgache.les resultats attendus :les communautés éloignées des districts visés par le projet auront accès aux établissements de santé primaire et à des médicaments de qualité, conférant tout son sens au concept de couverture sanitaire universelle.la mise en œuvre immédiate du projet permettra de :*déployer des drones pour livrer des produits essentiels et collecter des données numériques sur les services des établissements de santé et l'approvisionnement en médicaments*renforcer la capacité de la chaîne d'approvisionnement du ministère de la santé publique à fournir de tels services de manière régulière*impliquer la communauté locale et les agents de santé à travers des formations techniques e;Outlier Topic;0.0

hotel development and operation in croat hotel development and operation in croat project description: ashley oaks homes inc. of mississauga, ontario (ashley) intends to register a limited liability company in croatia in order to provide greenfield investment in the development, construction and operation of an 80-room hotel in the city of jastrebarsko, croatia (20 km south of the countrys capital city of zagreb) at an exit on the major highway zagreb  split/rijeka.   the total investment in the proposed project is in the range of between cad $5 and $6 million. the proposed 80-room hotel will employ 40 to 60 full-time and part-time employees.   the land proposed for the hotel development is privately owned. we have a pre-agreement with the owner to purchase the land. our offer to buy the land is conditional and will depend on the final decision we make upon completion of the viability study for the hotel development.   we have identified a need for hotels/motels at the exits along the highway zagreb  split/rijeka, such as at the exit jastrebarsko, 20 km south of the capital city of zagreb, especially during high tourism season (april  november). jastrebarsko is a commercial/industrial city close to zagreb and the slovenian border, with a demand for hotel rooms for business travellers and a need to accommodate other commercial activities outside of the tourism season and during local holidays.   during the past ten years, we visited croatia numerous times. our last visits were in april and june 2006. during this period we were also involved in projects in croatia such as export and installation of construction materials and construction and operation of commercial facilities such as banquet and conference facilities.   the design and construction of the proposed hotel will be managed by ashley and the new firm that will be registered in croatia. in the design, we will involve canadian and croatian architects and engineers in order to have canadian style hotel design in accordance with canadian and croatian standards. during construction, we will use materials and equipment available in croatia, but some will be imported from canada. during construction, we plan to use croatian construction firms with our construction supervisor(s) and some specialized tradesmen we may bring from canada.   the hotel operation will be managed by the new firm that will be registered in croatia. we had discussions with a canadian hotel manager with over 30 years of experience in hotel operations in toronto area, about potentially taking on the position of operational manager of our proposed hotel. he is of croatian origin and interested to re-locate to jastrebarsko, croatia.   the second option we may consider is to have a franchise agreement with a canadian or international hotel chain. the third option would be to establish a contractual agreement with an established hotel management firm to maintain standards under which the hotel will operate and train employees. we would manage the hotel with canadian and croatian management and local hotel staff as an independent operation, as is the common practice in croatia.   during the work on the viability study, we will provide further analysis and make our final decision. we have already initiated business contacts and discussions with the management of the canadian hotel chain monte carlo hotels from mississauga, ontario regarding the proposed hotel in croatia. we also explored a potential business relationship with hotel investment and operation firm vranich enterprises from hamilton, ontario, which owns several hotels in south ontario with a franchise agreement with hotel chains such as holiday inn express, staybridge suites (holiday inn) and garden inn (hilton).   we have done preliminary market research, technical capability and initial assessment of the proposed location and business. our next step would be to provide a viability study that would include a detailed market analysis, business plan, review of the projectscountries: croatia (100%)  sectors:;Tourism Sustainability Policy;0.0

impact evaluation of the covid-19 emergency cash transfers in peru impact evaluation of the covid-19 emergency cash transfers in peru the objective of this technical cooperation (tc) is to support the peruvian government in monitoring and evaluating the measures the authorities have implemented to counteract the covid-19 pandemic's negative effects on the welfare of poor and vulnerable households. this tc will fund the impact evaluation of a large-scale public program that is delivering unconditional emergency cash transfers to almost 7 million poor and vulnerable households in peru. the outputs produced by this tc will provide the ministry of finance in peru with estimates of the effects of the cash grants on consumption, labor market participation, physical and mental health, mortality, domestic violence, human capital investment, and intrahousehold dynamics, as well as access to credit and default patterns. this tc will provide the peruvian government with timely evidence that will enable them to improve their current policies aimed at supporting minimum consumption levels of poor and vulnerable people in the face of the crisis caused by covid-19 and future emergencies.governments around the globe have imposed mandatory quarantines to contain the expansion of the covid-19 pandemic. while these measures help to flatten the curve of contagion, they have triggered serious and unevenly spread economic consequences, particularly in a region, such as latin america, with a large informal sector. in peru, the first country in latin america and the caribbean to introduce a compulsory shelter-in-place order, the government sought to smooth the impact of the shock on the consumption of vulnerable households by providing a series of emergency cash transfers, a policy adopted by over 100 countries across the globe. since the pandemic began, the peruvian government has given unconditional emergency cash transfers to almost 80% of the most vulnerable households in the country. to date, about 8 million households have received pen 1520. this transfer is substantial, equivalent to twice the cost of the food basket used in the country to determine extreme poverty status for a family of four. the transfers initially targeted poor and extremely poor households, but it was later extended to cover vulnerable households. after the announcement of the initial round of transfers early on during the pandemic, the government instituted a second round in october 2020. given the emergence of a second wave and the delay in vaccination plans due to the country's political crisis, the peruvian government announced a third round of transfers at the beginning of 2021 and mandated a second stay-at-home order during february.;COVID-19 Humanitarian Aid;0.0

indonesia: java flood one indonesia: java flood one flooding represents the most frequently occurring hydrometeorological hazard in indonesia, contributing to around 31% of all disaster events recorded by the national disaster management agency. impacts from fluvial flooding in jakarta alone are estimated to cost around usd 321 million per year. due to java's topography, climate, dense urbanisation and inadequate infrastructure, improvements to structural flood defences alone are unlikely to prevent flooding in these areas in the future. instead, resilience needs to be built through the combined efforts of flood management information systems and greater public awareness. improved solutions to this problem would have a significant economic and social impact in the region as well as addressing multiple sustainable development goals including: goal 6: 'ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.' goal 11: 'make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.' and in particular, goal 11.5: 'by 2030, decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.' social benefits are difficult to estimate but the economic benefit of flood awareness alone is of the order of usd 400 for every usd 1 invested. the objective of this project is therefore to create a set of medium term flood forecast (mrff) tools for the urban centres of jakarta, bandung and surakarta on the island of java, indonesia. the skills and development associated with this project will be strongly embedded within bandung institute of technology (itb) and will depend on free software packages and cost effective data acquisition solutions such that itb will be able to independently develop similar mrff tools for other cities in indonesia following the cessation of the nerc funding. it is envisaged that developed workflows and methodologies can also be extended to flood affected oda countries beyond indonesia in the future. previous work has mostly focused on jakarta and has been limited to static return period flood risk maps using standard rainfall runoff modelling methods. we plan to improve on existing work by applying a dynamic stochastic meteorological model to provide medium term flood forecasts. so as to overcome excessive computational times associated with flood inundation models, we plan to wrap everything up within a probabilistic emulation framework. flooding in the areas of concern is made worse by continuous subsidence and anthropogenic topographic changes. therefore, we also plan to implement repeat photogrammetry surveys with drones, to capture and characterise these important effects. crucially, there will be focus group meetings with local flood affected communities to help inform the development of internet/social media flood warning dissemination tools. the research is designed using participatory approaches to enr;Outlier Topic;0.0

insertion of vulnerable groups in the labor market in the north east of brazil insertion of vulnerable groups in the labor market in the north east of brazil the productive inclusion of the beneficiaries of the bolsa família program (pbf) is a major challenge due to their low educational background and formal employment experience. despite the fact that this vulnerable population, mostly african descent, has great difficulty entering the formal labor market, the current context of economic growth and diversification of the northeast is ideal for stimulating productive inclusion mechanisms for these populations, mainly for the beneficiaries of conditional cash transfer programs.the main objective of this technical cooperation is to contribute to increasing the productive inclusion of the beneficiaries of the pbf and brazil without misery in the job market in the states of bahia, ceará and sergipe. specifically, this technical cooperation aims at: i) generating knowledge about the barriers these vulnerable groups face in the labor market, through studies and mappings of the major educational and training deficits, inefficiencies in the intermediation of low skilled manpower in the three brazilian states, ii) developing action plans that identify priority areas for state intervention in the areas of educational policies, training and intermediation of labor at the same time reducing gender and ethnic-racial inequalities in the states of bahia, ceará and sergipe, and iii ) promoting dialogues between different public and private actors at state and regional levels to generate proposals for policy reforms.the brazilian government recognizes the importance of productive inclusion of pbf beneficiaries, as it has been increasing access to training in the sectors of construction and tourism through the bolsa família planseq program. the federal and state level strategies aim not only at contributing to the interruption of the intergenerational transmission of poverty, but also to support brazilian employers in developing local skilled labor. it should be noted that, currently, these employers have difficulties in finding workers to fill their job vacancies independently on their educational profile.;Outlier Topic;0.0

ir amim - land rights in east jerusalem ir amim - land rights in east jerusalem core support to ir amim for their work with the protection of palestinian rights to land and socio-economic development in east jerusalem. ir amim is an israeli ngo based in jerusalem that monitors settlement expansion and palestinian land rights in the city. the organization was founded in the year 2000 with the aim of supporting jerusalem as a current home and a future shared capital for both israelis and palestinians. continued expansion of settlements in and around jerusalem, demolition and eviction threats against palestinians and the challenging of the status quo in relation to the temple mount / al-haram al-sharif make it increasingly difficult for palestinians living in east jerusalem and undermines a future two-state solution. ir amim's work aims to counteract these events and to promote the palestinian people's socio-economic rights in east jerusalem.ir amim has received grants from the ministry for foreign affairs since 2009. for the past five years, the support has been between sek 500,000 and sek 850,000 per year but in 2021 an increase was granted for a total grant of 1.2 msek. the mfa considers the activities well implemented and reported and has a favorable opinion of working with ir amim. given the strategic significance and long term commitment to ir amim, mfa has asked sida to consider taking over the support to the organization. this would enable a more long term support that will allow the organization better opportunity for planning ahead. it would also allow supporting capacity building measures for the organization. sida intends to provide core support to ir amim, as has also been the support-form that the ministry for foreign affairs has used in the last few years. sida proposes to raise the level of support to ir amim to 2 msek per year for a period of 3 years. that would equal a bit more than 10% of the organization  s total budget and make sida the 3rd largest donor.sida  s assessment is that the work of ir amim is aligned to the swedish strategy for palestine and well complements the human rights portfolio. the swedish strategy for development cooperation with palestine 2020-2024 highlights east jerusalem as a prioritised geographical area and the support to ir amim responds to the expectation expressed in the strategy that sida should be prepared to  respond to small scale initiatives of a strategic nature including initiatives aimed at following developments regarding settlement expansion .;Palestinian Dev/Conflict/Rights (WB/GZA);0.0

mapping conflict prevention innovation in africa/cartographie des innovations de prévention de conflits en afrique mapping conflict prevention innovation in africa/cartographie des innovations de prévention de conflits en afrique this project aims to strengthen conflict prevention knowledge.  it builds upon efforts by the united nations and the african union to understand what works and what does not in conflict prevention. the goal is to determine why some practices are more effective and efficient than others, and what enabling conditions allowed them to achieve positive outcomes on the ground. a major priority for this initiative is to produce information and analysis that is easily accessible and immediately actionable. the proposed platform allows users to better assess the evidence of conflict prevention practice. it also offers explanations for how specific interventions can be sequenced in a wide range of conflict scenarios, including how to best include women in mediation processes. the project plans to develop a typology of conflict prevention practices, map out effective practices in africa and develop a digital platform that visualizes both effective and ineffective conflict prevention practices over the past decade, and report back on findings. / ce projet vise améliorer la pratique et les connaissances relatives à la prévention des conflits.  il tire parti des efforts déployés par les nations unies et l'union africaine pour comprendre ce qui fonctionne et ce qui ne fonctionne pas dans la prévention des conflits. l'objectif est de découvrir pourquoi certaines pratiques sont plus efficaces que d'autres et les conditions habilitantes qui leur ont permis d'obtenir des résultats positifs sur le terrain. l'une des principales priorités de ce projet est la production d'information et d'analyses facilement accessibles et immédiatement applicables. la plateforme proposée permet aux utilisateurs de mieux évaluer les données de la pratique de prévention des conflits. cette plateforme offre aussi des explications quant à la façon dont certaines interventions peuvent être échelonnées dans un large éventail de scénarios de conflit, notamment comment intégrer au mieux les femmes dans les processus de médiation. le projet prévoit créer une typologie des pratiques de prévention des conflits, définir les pratiques efficaces en afrique et créer une plateforme numérique visualisant les pratiques efficaces de prévention des conflits au cours de la dernière décennie, et rendre compte des conclusions.;Peace Bldg Conflict Afr, Burundi;0.0

optimizing pmtct coverage and integration using mobile phone sms messaging and innovative visualization technology in kenya optimizing pmtct coverage and integration using mobile phone sms messaging and innovative visualization technology in kenya there is an urgent need to identify best practices in terms of health system strengthening to boost earlier advances in the area of maternal neonatal and child health (mnch) and prevention of mother to child transmission of hiv (pmtct). increased coverage of available and low-cost mnch and pmtct interventions could cut child mortality by 2/3 and maternal mortality by ¾. evidence-based decision-making and resource allocation for achieving continuous health services during pregnancy and the neonatal period for hiv positive women in resource-poor, high-risk urban settings in africa, emerge as tipping points for the millennium development goals. the rapidly expanding mobile phone market in africa offers a window of opportunity to use new ehealth solutions in an innovative way to strengthen health service delivery in resource-poor health systems. we will use a community intervention trial design to assess the effect of combining evidence-based mobile phone technology and best practice models for pmtct and health systems strengthening, on coverage, effectiveness and quality of pmtct in 4 urban slum settlements in kibera, nairobi covering 175,000 people. the interventions include mobile phone message support (weltel) from midwives to women via community health workers (chws), capacity building among chws and staff to improve quality of care, and, visualization of health data on program coverage using innovative e-tools to facilitate evidence-based planning.;MNCH mortality care;0.0

providing sewing machines, ring-wells, latrine ring slabs and solar panels for poor tribal families in remote hilly area of rangamati, bangladesh providing sewing machines, ring-wells, latrine ring slabs and solar panels for poor tribal families in remote hilly area of rangamati, bangladesh in the framework of this small-scale program, the embassy is funding the local ngo 'need for life society' (nfls) by providing sewing machines, ring-wells, latrine ring slabs and solar panels for poor tribal families in the remote hilly area of rangamati, bangladesh. most people living in this area strongly depend on agriculture. (drinking) water has to be collected at far-off tube-wells, work that mostly is done by women and children at the expense of their health and education. besides, most families in this region are cut off the electricity grid. that is why nfls considers necessary the purchase of solar panels. through the project, nfls aims to make access to clean water and safe energy sources for light generation easier. nfls is hoping to thus relieve women and children who could then do a different work or go to school instead. plus, solar-powered light that is also working during night increases security and allows the people to continue working and learning in the evening.;Outlier Topic;0.0

rapid prereview: a rapid preprint review platform to support outbreak science rapid prereview: a rapid preprint review platform to support outbreak science programme: open research fund. description: early, open sharing of scientific information can be facilitated via preprints, scientific manuscripts that are freely shared online prior to editorial peer review. in the context of infectious disease outbreaks, accelerating the dissemination of scientific evidence is of utmost importance. decisions must be made quickly and leverage the best available evidence as it evolves. as preprints are increasingly adopted in the life sciences, it is essential that we build new tools – and a community around them – to help scientists rapidly and openly assess their value and validity. the goal of this proposal is to solicit funding for a collaboration between prereview and outbreak science to build an interoperable, extension to the prereview open source platform to facilitate rapid assessment of preprints during public health crises or when adapted in other disciplines requiring rapid reviews. the rapid prereview tool will allow researchers to quickly provide high-level evaluation of preprints via a series of questions that assess the originality and soundness of the findings. results will be aggregated and visualized instantaneously to allow users to identify the most relevant information. to maximize engagement from the community, we will organize and facilitate sprint-like events to get specific input from diverse users, build content, and promote the use of the tool. we believe this tool, paired with collaborative, community sprint-like events, has the capacity to be transformative for on-the-ground workers, researchers, policy makers and the public alike as we help target and unlock key scientific information.;Outlier Topic;0.0

shield for justice - access to justice for witnesses and victims of human rights violations free from intimidation and compromise shield for justice - access to justice for witnesses and victims of human rights violations free from intimidation and compromise since inception devolution has continued experienced teething problems and power wrangles between the national and county governments. county governments have also experienced in-fighting and corruption. it is anticipated that this will continue for most of 2015 and start cooling off in 2016. it is projected that the residual aspect of this struggle will be the clamour for increased resource allocation by county governments. the effect of all this will be politicization of genuine issues of governance and overshadowing in the media of other core matters affecting the public (e.g. human rights violations) by news coverage of these power wrangles which media houses seem to relish. further at both county and national level it is expected that activists championing reforms and calling for accountability for bad governance will face opposition intimidation and threats. organizations and activists operating at county level are likely to be more vulnerable than those functioning at national level.the change of the system of governance and the implementation of the new constitution resulted in the increase of state expenditure. this has led to a strain in the financial resources in government. further consequences include industrial action by civil servants opposition to reforms by the salaries and remuneration commission the increase oftaxation on kenyans increase of cost of living and redundancy. the national pulse for stress among kenyans is growing and this is reflected in various expressions of violence especially in the form of diverse kinds of conflicts connected to access to resources. it is anticipated that this will persist upto 2017 and will form the basis for political campaigns by aspirants. increased politicization and propaganda by the ruling coalition of the advocacy efforts of csos in challenging impunity has weakened the sector through intimidation threats and discouragement. solidarity among csos is at an all-time low because of fear of reprisals and mistrust among organizations. the deputy president?s case at the icc is at an advanced and crucial stage. this means that witnesses their families and intermediaries are still subject to ridicule intimidation and possible aggression with attendant anxiety and other forms of psychological harm. it is project that this matter will not be concluded until late 2016.;Outlier Topic;0.0

strengthening governance in health systems for reproductive health and rights in pakistan strengthening governance in health systems for reproductive health and rights in pakistan pakistan, with the world's sixth largest population, is part of a region that is notorious for its social and gender inequities. as a low-income country, its population has faced numerous economic challenges, especially in the last two decades. these economic hardships have magnified the country's underlying social and gender inequities. social sectors, including health, are generally the first to suffer under economic woes. over the past decade, the country's security situation has also spiralled downwards. as a result, pakistan's health system has suffered and health service delivery has worsened. those most affected are the vulnerable social groups, including the poor and women. services catering to women's needs are grossly inadequate. weaknesses in the ministry of health, especially those related to governance, also affect services for women, especially those associated to sexual and reproductive health. this four-year project aims to strengthen health systems governance for reproductive health and rights in pakistan. the research team will use a three-pronged intervention model to enhance rights by ensuring accountability for government and service providers. shirkat gah, the women's resource centre, will lead the project, which aims to build skills and knowledge in the planning and implementation sections of pakistan's ministry of population welfare, ministry of health, and civil society organizations. using a case study design, the research team will assess the model's viability as a tool to strengthen health systems governance for reproductive health and rights. the project team will also generate tools and recommendations to apply the model in other countries in south asia. researchers will conduct the study at the district level with two districts selected in each of the two main provinces of punjab and sindh, and one district in each of the two smaller regions of khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan. project outputs include piloted tools and training modules to: -assess health systems governance for sexual and reproductive health, -evaluate health systems governance for community accountability mechanisms, -generate rights-based evidence, and, -transfer knowledge to civil society organizations.;Outlier Topic;0.0

sustainable development programme 2016 sustainable development programme 2016 away from the world cities that comprise a large part of the stock of economic activity globally, many 'ordinary' cities of the developing countries nevertheless are home to an inventiveness that is informal and as yet uncharted. in this research we propose to map the extent inventiveness across the informal businesses found in the urban villages (kampongs) in three indonesian cities (solo, bandung and semarang) to gauge: (a) the extent of innovation, (b) the nature of innovation (incremental/radical, new to individual, new to market), (c) the originators (male or female) and the origin (endogenous or adapted, business or household), (d) the impacts, and (e) the aspirations of entrepreneurs. in light of (e) we also propose to explore in outline terms the potential for these informal business ideas to be commercialized, to form part of alternative social or non-market economies, or indeed for them to be protected against such developments.;Outlier Topic;0.0

tbl the road to your right tbl the road to your right detailed description of the activity the project focuses on economic empowerment of women - victims of domestic violence - through vocational education and employment. within the framework of the project, 90 women victims of violence will acquire the profession of gardening and landscape design in georgia. beneficiaries of the avng (applicant organization) shelter/crisis center, as well as beneficiaries of shelters run by the state and by partner organizations working on issues of violence against women shall participate in the vocational training courses. the territory of the shelter of avng, which is 4,000-square-meters, with the infrastructure that allows for both theoretical and practical lessons, shall be used for the training. plants grown during the practical lessons will be sold through social networks and part of the proceeds from the sales will be provided to the beneficiaries, which will help them in their economic empowerment, while part will be accumulated to ensure sustainability of the project. in addition to the economic benefits, the project is expected to have a significant impact on improving physical and mental health and well-being of beneficiaries, as gardening and work with soil is one of the most common forms of eco-therapy used as an intervention for reduction of post-traumatic stress disorder in women victims of violence. thus, introducing eco-therapy as a rehabilitation direction will be an important tool in the process of psychosocial rehabilitation of abused women. in georgia, gardening and landscape design are considered to be a man's work. involvement of women in these activities will help to change this gender stereotype and promote establishment of such perceptions in the society, as to focus not on division of work as designated for women or men, but on their professionalism. the applicant sees this project as setting a clear example of how to help escape from violent environment thanks to economic empowerment through vocational education and employment.;Gender-based Violence Prevention/Response;0.0

training on new penal code to improve enforcement of wildlife laws in vietnam training on new penal code to improve enforcement of wildlife laws in vietnam the purpose of this project is two-fold: to counter wildlife trafficking in vietnam by training enforcement officers to improve the enforcement of vietnam's revised penal code on wildlife trafficking, thus reducing the number of animals removed from the wild and increasing risk for wildlife criminals, and to identify urgent priority needs for enforcement capacity building, which can serve as the basis of future work. this project is intended to conserve the wildlife trafficked in vietnam, both endemic species and their products and those that are smuggled in and out of the country, by addressing the impacts of wildlife trafficking through heightened enforcement by relevant law enforcement agencies. species affected by wildlife trafficking in vietnam include rhinos, elephants,.pangolins, tigers, bears, leopards, turtles and other reptiles. specific activities include: (1) implementing vietnamese expert-led trainings to 300 wildlife enforcement officials whose posts are located in previously identified key wildlife trafficking hotspots throughout the country, which will provide basic.enforcement training as well as address changes in procedures resulting from the new penal code, and (2) providing an opportunity to collect data on urgent priority needs of enforcement officials (such as equipment and training) that will enable them to do their work in general and in light of the new penal code and other factors.;Outlier Topic;0.0

tti phase 2 institutional support: african heritage institution (afriheritage) tti phase 2 institutional support: african heritage institution (afriheritage) the think tank initiative (tti) is a multi-donor program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions - or  think tanks  - in developing countries, enabling them to better provide sound research that both informs and influences policy. following an initial phase (2008 -2014), the second phase of the think tank initiative (2014-2019) will fund 43 institutions. phase 2 aims to help grantees consolidate their role as credible development actors in their countries, and in some cases regionally and internationally.  this document provides both an overview of the funding and capacity building framework that will apply to all 43 think tanks, as well as specific information for afriheritage including their tailored objectives, along tti s three pillars: research quality, organizational development, and policy engagement. experience from tti s phase 1, has shown that policy actors in developing countries are becoming more open to accessing and using research evidence for policy making and are placing a higher value on research data and analysis. however, local funding to local research institutions is still limited in the regions where tti works.with the 4.5 year term tti core grant support, afriheritage is expected to have: -accumulated a shareable body of high-quality research findings, data and analysis in focal policy relevant areas - business environment and competitiveness across nigerian states, macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, economic governance, trade and regional integration for inclusive growth, agriculture and food security,-attracted and retained a sufficient number of high-calibre research staff,-a strong quality assurance system in place which is applied to every research project,-institutionalised, and implemented, an adequate and effective communication strategy and system,-established and implemented an adequate and effective resource mobilization strategy for financial and organizational sustainability.;Outlier Topic;0.0

youth, poverty, and use of icts: constructing new democratic public spheres youth, poverty, and use of icts: constructing new democratic public spheres violence toward youth in brazil is among the highest in the world. however, youth in poor and violent neighbourhoods of rio de janeiro are using new technologies to make their voices heard.brazil has achieved remarkable economic success, surpassing britain this year as the world's sixth largest economy. however, the country has the fourth highest rate of youth violence in the world, and murder remains the leading cause of death among young people. youth in the favelas (poor neighbourhoods) of rio de janeiro are particularly vulnerable to violence. there, violence both results from, and perpetuates, a wide gap between rich and poor. the connection between violence and the drug trade, exacerbated by media reports and government policy, has pushed these youth even further to the margins of public discourse.despite these barriers, youth in these violent contexts are finding new ways to participate in democracy and strengthen their resilience to violence through information and communications technology (ict). icts can include such things as social networks (e.g., facebook and twitter), social media networks (e.g., idealist and takingitglobal), and digital media platforms (e.g., youtube, myspace and the youth media exchange project),the project will document how vulnerable youth in the favelas of rio de janeiro are experimenting with new forms of political participation and activism using icts. a team of local researchers will develop case studies to examine the role that these new technologies are playing in defining (and re-defining), enhancing and transforming the way youth participate in politics and social activism in rio's marginalized neighbourhoods. the project will examine the kinds of icts youth are using and how they are using them to have a political voice. the project will also look at how politicians are responding to this 'digital activism' to determine not only their attitudes, but also how successful icts are as a political tool. the research will specifically look at the gender dimensions of digital activism and document any differences between young men and women that may be affecting or provoked by this mode of political participation. the case studies produced by the project will help to expand understanding about the importance of icts as a political medium for marginalized populations, particularly youth. the project aims to increase awareness among youth about how they can mobilize to exercise their rights and improve the quality of their lives. it also aims to influence the way government authorities and policy-makers view and interact with disadvantaged youth.;Outlier Topic;0.0
